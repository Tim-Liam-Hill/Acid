# ACID

Implementing my idea for a programming language

The idea: I want something that looks like DNA sequence, and is Turing complete.

Didn't know about DNA-Sharp before I started designing it. Technically it isn't original but our implementations are different. Something interesting about both of our languages is that you can make both of them look like DNA in when you write them using --- (actually no, mine requires something a bit different, but I can make a mode like that with the recipricols???) but still, differences between both of our languages. There are obviously other DNA languages but mine is unique for following reasons:

TODO: add reasons. 

In any case, the idea was to have fun and work on something interesting. I enjoy programming language design and concepts surrounding it. Plus its an excuse to program, which I haven't done in a while.

## Properties

* Stack based - arithmatic operations work in stack based manner (refer to textbook) (its easier)
* Two stacks as this allows for  Simulating a Turing Machine
* Base 4 number system
* Everything is an opcode (codon) made up of Nueclotides
* Any non-nucleotide character is interpreted as a comment (better make sure you type in lower caps!!!)

Datatypes? 

* Basically one Datatype
* Can be interpreted as Asci.

Functions 

* You define the name
* then function body is up until the return statement.

If any of these decisions do not make sense to you, maybe you should try more psychedelics. If it doesn't make sense to you, that is likely a good thing. 

## Visualisation

If we want the visualisation to come out nicely then the recipricol needs to be the redundant for each opcode. We may also need to do some magic with our number system. My visualisation is different in this way: lets say our program is 'AAC CAA GTG ACA'. This represents one side of the DNA sequence, so to do 

AA

C-C

A--A 

Doesn't make sense. Instead there would be a reciprocal side: the complement:

AT

A-T

C--G and so on. 


That's how my visualisation will work.

## Questions

*Can you define nested functions?* 

We can do it, it will just be effort. Will need a scope table. Nested functions would only be accessible within their scope though because otherwise that is just effort. 

*What is function scope?* 

Functions are just glorified labels really. 

*Can we make the DNA look cool like the other example?* 

I hope so. 

*How are we going to handle nested while loops?*

Match to nearest and while, doesn't have the same issue that functions have due to unique names (lack thereof)
